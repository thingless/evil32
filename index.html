          The usage of GPG has grown steadily yet the tooling that supports it has remained stagnant despite staggering hardware advancement. Choices that seemed reasonable 15 years ago (e.g. 32bit key ids) are obsolete. Using modern GPUs, we have found collisions for every 32bit key id in the WOT's(Web of Trust) strong set. Although this does not break GPG's encryption, it further erodes the usability of GPG and increases the chance of human error.

          <h3>Check your fingerprints</h3>
          Key servers do not use transport encryption (e.g. SSL) and GPG does not verify keys received when using <code>--recv-keys</code> leaving communicaiton with key servers vulnerable to MITM (man in the middle) or DNS attacks. GPG assumes you have manually checked your keys with <code>--fingerprint</code>.

        <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-6">
          <h3>Stop using 32bit key ids</h3>
          <p>It takes 4 seconds to generate a colliding 32bit key id on a GPU (using <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lachesis/scallion">scallion</a>). Key servers do little verification of uploaded keys and allow keys with colliding 32bit ids. Further, GPG uses 32bit key ids throughout its interface and does not warn you when an operation might apply to multiple keys.</p>

          <h3>Examples</h3>
          <h4>GPG does not verify received keys</h4>
          <p>GPG simply imports whatever the key server sends. No verfication of the response is done before importing.
          <i>It is assumed keys are verified with <code>--recv-keys</code></i>. In the example below, a key is being requested and GPG blindly imports a different key.</p>
<pre>
<b>free@turing ~$</b> gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 10000001

<b>gpg:</b> requesting key 10000001 from hkp server pgp.mit.edu
<b>gpg:</b> key 0BADBEEF: public key "Evil32" imported
<b>gpg:</b> Total number processed: 1
<b>gpg:</b> imported: 1 (RSA: 1)
</pre>

        <a name="duplicate-recv-key-example"></a><h4>32bit key ids are not secure</h4>
        <p>In the example below, a key is being requested with its 32bit key id. The key server has two keys with the specified key id and GPG imports both keys. It is easy to generate and publish a key that looks identical if you only use 32 bits when specifying a key.</p>
<pre>
<b>free@turing ~$</b> gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 10000001

<b>gpg:</b> requesting key 10000001 from hkp server pgp.mit.edu
<b>gpg:</b> key 10000001: public key "John Doe" imported
<b>gpg:</b> key 10000001: public key "Jane Doe" imported
<b>gpg:</b> Total number processed: 2
<b>gpg:</b>            imported: 2  (RSA: 2)

        <h3>Q&amp;A</h3>
        <h4>Where is the source code for the tool you used to duplicate the strong set?</h4>
        <p>The tool is called Scallion and the source can be found at <a href="https://github.com/lachesis/scallion" target="_blank">https://github.com/lachesis/scallion</a>.</p> 

        <h4>Is your clone of the strong set publicly available?</h4>
        <p>Yes. The key server which holds the cloned keys is available at <a href="http://pgp.evil32.com" target="_blank">http://pgp.evil32.com</a>.</p>

        <h4>How could GPG be fixed?</h4>
        <p>Key exchange is hard and there are no perfect solutions. That being said, there are some changes that could be made to GPG to make things better.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you specify a key id or fingerprint when using <code>--recv-keys</code> GPG should verify that the key/keys returned by the key server actually have the key id or fingerprint you requested.</li>
          <li>When it's ambiguous what key an operation should act on (because of key id collisions or uuid collisions) GPG should refuse to perform the operation automatically. This would fix the issue of <a href="#duplicate-recv-key-example">receiving keys</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Aren't you suppose to use the Web of Trust to verify the authenticity of keys?</h4>
        <p>Absolutely! The web of trust is a great mechanism by which to verify keys but its complicated and as a result often not used. There are examples of GPG being used without the Web of Trust all over the web.</p>
        <blockquote>The Warning: "no ultimately trusted keys found" means that gpg was not configured to ultimately trust a specific key. Trust settings are part of OpenPGPs Web-of-Trust which does not apply here. - <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt" target="_blank"/>Debian SecureApt Wiki</a></blockquote>
